   values only).
3. Now your server is successfully setup. A dialog box should open for the same.
4. Now run the client file.
5. It will create a client. Enter a username, check the 'client' checkbox, and enter the same 
   port as entered in the server.
6. The client will be created and connected to the server. A dialog box will open for it.
7. Now the user can send textual/numeric messages to and fro from client to server. Additionally 
   it also allows to send files, or emojis.
